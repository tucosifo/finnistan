                    On December 11th, 2021, at 1:00 PM, Finn Putnam and his sister signed the Declaration of Independence of the Empire of Finnistan. Although the nation officially declared independence, the citizenship form was open since December 6th, 2021.

                    Prior to founding the Empire of Finnistan, Finn was a part of Fuzzbertia since shortly after its founding in 2018. Although Finn was enthusiastic about Fuzzbertia in 2018 and shortly into 2019, before becoming inactive in the nation. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Finn founded the Kingdom of Sifoland, a shortly lived nation that never gained any more citizens than Finn himself, and was disbanded only weeks later.

                    The last micronation Finn was solely a part of before Finnistan's founding was the Uviet Sonion. Founded in October 2021, the Uviet Sonion was a communist micronation in Upstate New York, and was the predecessor to the Moscow Federation (now known as the Hudson Federation). The Uviet Sonion, throughout its entire existence, was at war with the ACR (Anti-Communist Rebellion) led by Jackson's brother. When Finnistan was founded on December 11th, 2021, the Uviet Sonion threatened to attack and annex the Empire. Finn was aided in creating a plan for war by the ACR and Fuzzbertia, however, by the end of the day, the Uviet Sonion took back the threats, and offered an alliance rather than a rivalry.
